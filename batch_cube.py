"""
An implementation of an array Rubic's cubes.

Actions are stored in this order (corresponding to these numbers)
    0:L, 1:L', 2:R, 3:R', 4:U, 5:U', 6:D, 7:D', 8:F, 9:F', 10:B, 11:B'

Internally the cube is stored as an integer array of dimension ? x 54
    One row for each cube, stored in a way easy to import into PyCuber (for printing)
    The numbers 0-5 correspond to the colors RYGWOB
    The nth block of 9 numbers corresponds to the nth face (in the order RYGWOB)
    E.g. the solved cube is stored as 
        000000000011111111111222222222233333333334444444444555555555

When it is outputed to a bit array (for the NN) it is stored as ? x 54 x 6
